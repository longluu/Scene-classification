# SceneClassification
In this project, I compare the performance of a scene classification model that is based on low-frequency components of amplitude spectrum (see Oliva & Torralba (2001)) and human fast perception of images. The conclusion is that human perception depends more on phase information than amplitude of the spatial spectrum.

Or you can see the same report "Scene classification.pdf" (but without animation)
