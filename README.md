## Overview
In this project, I compare the performance of a scene classification computer vision model that is based on low-frequency components of amplitude spectrum (Oliva & Torralba, 2001) and human fast perception of images. I found that human perception is very different from the model, that is, their performance relies more heavily on the phase (local) information in the image. In contrast, the gist-based computer vision model relies mainly on the amplitude spectrum (global features) of the image.

Or you can see the same report "Scene classification.pdf" (but without animation).
